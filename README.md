# SymbolicComputation
As a fun little project, I want to create an environment that can deal with symbolic math. The first goal is to familarize myself with tools like poetry and pytest. The second goal, more mathematical, is to provide functionality where the user can define a polynomial (ideal)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_(ring_theory)#Ideal_generated_by_a_set] and find a (Gr√∂bner basis)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gr%C3%B6bner_basis] for it.
